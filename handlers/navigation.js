// ==========================================
// NAVIGATION — INTERACTION HANDLER
// ==========================================
// the global nav bar. Lifted out of handlers/router.js on 2026-08-13 17:45 EDT (docs/ROADMAP.md's index.js split). The branch bodies are VERBATIM -- only their address changed.
//
// Ownership is decided by custom_id prefix, once, before any branch runs: `nav_`. Those prefixes are matched by no other subsystem (checked mechanically at extraction time), so deciding ownership up front cannot change which handler wins, and every branch below keeps the exact `return` it was written with.
//
// ⚠️ THE CRASH NET IS THE ROUTER'S, NOT THIS FILE'S. handleNavigationInteraction is awaited from inside handlers/router.js's single top-level try/catch -- do not add one here, do not register listeners, and keep every error-branch reply an AWAITED call in its own small try/catch. A bare `return interaction.reply(...)` can reject after the try has exited and escape the net. See .claude/rules/interaction-router.md.
